What is problem of using English instead of Korean while studying or doing anything as I being Korean? I thought that I murmurred because I was lack of self-esteem. And I have learned English even before I felt comfortable with native language. 

I have been not sure that some conditions affected me in a bad way. It has been certain in my consious that I could even picked some unrelated concrete facts which exerting energy on my mental condition. I was searching for the answer in wrong place.

Being fragile to porn and game was main issue for a long time. Mental energy is limited and fatique last long if I did not have a sound sleep. It causes less concentration throughout a day.

Bad habbit of escaping from the very matter has been haunting me over a decade. 

Believe it or not, I found that write anything in my mind in the very moment was helpful. That vortex in my brain is spinning all day long not exactly in the right direciton. 

And I have trained my self that my brain could prolong under harsh condition. I am pretty sure that I could endure some amount of discomfort to be better person.
